The scenarios for below questions are implemented under folder tests and file checkers.spec.js

I – The Checkers Game
For this exercise, implement the following steps:
1. Navigate to https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/checkers/
2. Confirm that the site is up
3. Make five legal moves as orange:
a) Include taking a blue piece
b) Use “Make a move” as confirmation that you can take the next step
c) Restart the game after five moves
d) Confirm that the restarting had been successful
You’ll find that the game engine is predictable enough to allow for you to win a game reliably.
So, you can try for this if you’re inclined and have a little time left over.
II – The Card Game
For this exercise:
1. Navigate to https://deckofcardsapi.com/
2. Confirm the site is up
3. Get a new deck
4. Shuffle it
5. Deal three cards to each of two players
6. Check whether either has blackjack

7. If either has, write out which one does
Keep in mind that, for these exercises, quality wins over quantity. Showcase your coding
craftsmanship and standards.
